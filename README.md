### Library

---

This is a university project from the Fundamentals of Programming course.
This application simulates a library in where we can do the following:
- Add a book
- Remove a book
- Update a book
- Rent a book
- Return a book
- See statistics(e.g. Most rented book, Most active client, Most rented author)

The user can choose how to open the application by modifying the settings.properties file.
He may select how to save the data from the repository(text file, json file, pickle file) and how the interface is represented(graphical or console).

The graphical interface was made for a bonus point, did it the night before the presentation of the assignment, so, lots of spaghetti code :(.
